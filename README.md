# python-for-pen-testing

This repo contains a TCP server, TCP client, an nmap scanner, banner grabber and port scanner all made in Python. 

I'm following the Information Security path on freecodecamp linked here - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/.

Hurdles I've come across  
- python-nmap is funky in windows and required alot of tinkering to set up 
- what to scan, but i have found http://scanme.nmap.org/!
- hack this site is also useful for this course, and can be used for the portScanner - just ping the site first
