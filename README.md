# python-for-pen-testing

This repo contains a TCP server, TCP client, a banner grabber and an nmap scanner all made in Python. 

I'm following the Information Security path on freecodecamp linked here - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/

Problems 
- python-nmap is funky in windows and required alot of tinkering to set up 
- what to scan, but i have found http://scanme.nmap.org/!
